It can replace the expensive traditional SAN storage.\\n\\n## The local storage is smart, stable, and agile\\n\\n- Automatic operation and maintenance management\\n  \\n  Automatically discover, identify, manage, and allocate disks. Intelligently schedule applications and data based on affinity. Automatically monitor the disk status and give early warning in time.\\n\\n- Highly available data\\n  \\n  Use inter-node replicas to synchronize data for high availability. When a problem occurs, the application will be automatically scheduled to a highly available data node to guarantee the application continuity.\\n\\n- Multiple data volume types are supported\\n  \\n  Aggregate HDD, SSD, and NVMe disks to provide data service with low latency and high throughput.\\n\\n- Flexible and dynamic linear expansion\\n  \\n  A dynamic expansion is supported according to the cluster size, to flexibly meet the data persistence needs of applications.\\n\\n## Enrich scenarios and widely adapt to enterprise needs\\n\\n- Adapt to middlewares with high available architecture\\n  \\n  Kafka, Elasticsearch, Redis, and other middleware applications have high available architecture and strict requirements for IO data access. The LVM-based single-replica local data volume provided by HwameiStor can well meet their requirements.\\n\\n- Provide highly available data volumes for applications\\n  \\n  MySQL and other OLTP databases require the underlying storage to provide highly available data storage, which can quickly restore data in case of problems. At the same time, it is also required to guarantee high-performance data access. The dual-replica high available data volume provided by HwameiStor can well meet such requirements.\\n\\n- Automated operation and maintenance of traditional storage software\\n  \\n  MinIO, Ceph, and other storage software need to use the disks on a kubernetes node. These software can utilize PVC/PV to automatically use the single-replica local volume of HwameiStor through CSI drivers, quickly respond to the deployment, expansion, migration, and other requests from the business system, and realize the automatic operation and maintenance based on Kubernetes.\\n\\n## Join us\\n\\nIf the coming future is an era of intelligent Internet, developers will be the pioneers to that milestone, and the open source community will become the \\"metaverse\\" of developers.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the HwameiStor cloud-native local storage system, welcome to join the community to explore this metaverse world dedicated for developers and grow together."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-04-22-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-04-22-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the Hwameistor blog space.","date":"2022-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"Hwameistor","permalink":"/blog/tags/hwameistor"}],"readingTime":0.4,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Yao","title":"Technical Writer","url":"https://github.com/windsonsea","imageURL":"https://github.com/windsonsea.png","key":"Michael"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["Michael"],"tags":["hello","Hwameistor"]},"prevItem":{"title":"HwameiStor Comes Online","permalink":"/blog/1"}},"content":"Welcome to the Hwameistor blog space.\\n\\nHere you can keep up with the progress of the Hwameistor open source project and recent hot topics.\\n\\nWe also plan to include release notes for major releases, guidance articles, community-related events, and possibly some development tips, and interesting topics within the team.\\n\\nIf you are interested in contributing to this open source project and would like to join the discussion or make some guest blog posts, please contact us.\\n\\nGitHub address is: https://github.com/hwameistor"}]}')}}]);
