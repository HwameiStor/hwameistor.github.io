HwameiStor creates a local storage resource pool for centrally managing all disks such as HDD, SSD, and NVMe. It uses the CSI architecture to provide distributed services with local volumes, and provides data persistence capabilities for stateful cloud-native workloads or components.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="System architecture" src="/assets/images/architect-5b800d6ed2893aea97ee9b52dd53a1a2.jpg" width="1080" height="423" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>In the cloud native era, application developers can focus on the business logic itself, while the agility, scalability, and reliability required by the application runtime attribute to the infrastructure platform and O&amp;M team. <strong>Hwameistor is a storage system that grows in the cloud native era. </strong>It has the advantages of high availability, automation, cost-efficiency, rapid deployment, and high performance. It can replace the expensive traditional SAN storage.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="the-local-storage-is-smart-stable-and-agile">The local storage is smart, stable, and agile<a class="hash-link" href="#the-local-storage-is-smart-stable-and-agile" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Automatic operation and maintenance management</p><p>Automatically discover, identify, manage, and allocate disks. Intelligently schedule applications and data based on affinity.

The LVM-based single-replica local data volume provided by HwameiStor can well meet their requirements.</p></li><li><p>Provide highly available data volumes for applications</p><p>MySQL and other OLTP databases require the underlying storage to provide highly available data storage, which can quickly restore data in case of problems. At the same time, it is also required to guarantee high-performance data access. The dual-replica high available data volume provided by HwameiStor can well meet such requirements.</p></li><li><p>Automated operation and maintenance of traditional storage software</p><p>MinIO, Ceph, and other storage software need to use the disks on a kubernetes node. These software can utilize PVC/PV to automatically use the single-replica local volume of HwameiStor through CSI drivers, quickly respond to the deployment, expansion, migration, and other requests from the business system, and realize the automatic operation and maintenance based on Kubernetes.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="join-us">Join us<a class="hash-link" href="#join-us" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>If the coming future is an era of intelligent Internet, developers will be the pioneers to that milestone, and the open source community will become the "metaverse" of developers.</p><p>If you have any questions about the HwameiStor cloud-native local storage system, welcome to join the community to explore this metaverse world dedicated for developers and grow together.</p>]]></content>
